\title{News for Package "showtext"}

\section{Changes in showtext version 0.7-1}{
  \itemize{
    \item Fixed an issue for the MS Gothic font
          (\href{https://github.com/yixuan/showtext/issues/29}{#29})
  }
}

\section{Changes in showtext version 0.7}{
  \itemize{
    \item Now a new rule for the default font family is made: if the user does not
          specify a font family, then the default one will be used to
          render the text. If all characters in the string have Unicodes smaller than 1024,
          then the default font family is "sans"; otherwise "wqy-microhei" is used
    \item Fixed the \code{VignetteBuilder} entry in the \code{DESCRIPTION} file
          according to CRAN's policy
  }
}

\section{Changes in showtext version 0.6}{

  }
}

\section{Changes in showtext version 0.5}{
  \itemize{
    \item All previous API functions now have aliases replacing the dots
          with underscores in the function names, for example \code{showtext_auto()}
          is equivalent to \code{showtext.auto()}. The "underscore" naming is
          preferred, and the "dot" version will be gradually \strong{deprecated}
    \item Fixed PROTECT errors detected by CRAN
    \item Registered native routines per CRAN's policy
  }
}

          saving a lot of typing
    \item Better visual effect for a number of bitmap and on-screen devices
          including \code{png()}, \code{jpeg()}, \code{tiff()}, \code{bmp()},
          \code{x11()} and \code{windows()}. For these devices we use
          raster image rather than polygons to draw text
    \item Options setting has been moved to a new function \code{showtext.opts()}
