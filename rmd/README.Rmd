# Summary

3DViz is a 3D/4D visualization dashboard, written in [R 3.6.2](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/old/3.6.2/) with a [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) backend, that produces publishable high-dimensional figures. 3DViz is pre-packaged with a complete computational engine. As such, 3DViz can be downloaded, configured, and launched utilizing an end-user's local system as its server.

# Download/Configure

3DViz can be downloaded from its [Github](https://github.com/ryEllison/3DViz) repo. Once downloaded, the __config.bat__ executable should be launched to ensure proper backend configuration on the user's local system before use. 3DViz configuration is only needed once. 

# Use

After 3DViz configuration, the application can be launched and used as follows:

1. Launch via the __\_init\_.bat__ executable 

    + A terminal will open indicating the creation of a local server 

2. After the server is created, an internet browser (e.g., Chrome or Firefox) should be opened

3. __localhost:3838__ should be entered as a web address 

    + This will launch a local version of the Shiny dashboard

4. A file browser will appear, and the user can navigate to and select a __\*.csv__ dataset

    + The data file should be structured such that each column represents a vector of data (datasets meant for testing purposes can be referred to as examples)

5. Once a dataset is selected, 3DViz will load in the data and open

    + User controls can be manipulated to select vectors of data to plot, alter characteristics of the plot, and export different versions as pdf files

# Test

When 3DViz is launched (see __Use__), a file browser will appear. Inside the file browser should be a __data__ directory in which are three toy datasets. The user should select one of these datasets, plot the data, and export the figure as a test of proper configuration of the Shiny dashboard.
