# Summary

3DViz is a dynamic 3D/4D visualization dashboard, written in [R 3.6.2](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/old/3.6.2/) with a [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) backend, that produces publishable high-dimensional figures.

# Deployed 3DViz

3DViz was deployed using [shiny.io by Rstudio](https://www.shinyapps.io/), and can be found here: [https://ryellison.shinyapps.io/3dviz/](https://ryellison.shinyapps.io/3dviz/).

## Use

Once 3DViz is launched, the user should select a dataset via the browser button. The data file should be structured such that each column represents a vector of data. For example:

```{r, tbl, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.height = 2.25}

##Sys block
options(warn = -1)

# ##Library block
# library(ggplot2)
# library(gridExtra)
# 
# ##Code block
# table <- read.csv('./rmd/fts/geomData.csv')
# tbl <- tableGrob(head(table), rows = NULL)
# grid.arrange(tbl)

##Library block
library(knitr)

##Code block
include_graphics('./rmd/fts/tbl.png')

```

<br/> Once data is loaded, user controls can be manipulated to select vectors of data to plot, alter characteristics of the plot, and export different versions as .pdf files.

# Local 3DViz

The local version of 3DViz is pre-packaged with a complete computational engine. As such, 3DViz can be downloaded, configured, and launched utilizing an end-user's local system as its server. Note, there may be compatibility issues with the native computational engine.

## Download/Configure

3DViz can be downloaded from its [Github](https://github.com/ryEllison/3DViz) repo. Once downloaded, the __config.bat__ executable should be launched to ensure proper backend configuration on the user's local system before use. 3DViz configuration is only needed once. 

## Use

After 3DViz configuration, the application can be launched and used as follows:

1. Launch via the __\_init\_.bat__ executable 

    + A terminal will open indicating the creation of a local server ("Listening on...") 

2. After the server is created, an internet browser (e.g., Chrome or Firefox) should be opened

3. __localhost:3838__ should be entered as a web address 

    + This will launch a local version of the Shiny dashboard

4. A file browser will appear, and the user can navigate to and select a __\*.csv__ dataset

    + The data file should be structured such that each column represents a vector of data (see __Deployed 3DViz, Use__)

5. Once a dataset is selected, 3DViz will load in the data and open

    + User controls can be manipulated to select vectors of data to plot, alter characteristics of the plot, and export different versions as pdf files

## Test

When 3DViz is launched (see __Use__), a file browser will appear. Inside the file browser should be three toy datasets. The user should select one of these datasets, plot the data, and export figures as a test of proper configuration and function of the Shiny dashboard.
